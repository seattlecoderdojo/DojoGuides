# Seattle CoderDojo Guides

**WARNING:** We are just starting to build out our guide content, so there may be topics for which we do not have guides (or not many). Please be patient. Everyone making these is a volunteer. Check the Resources section below if you'd like to help make them.

## What are Guides?

Guides are modular exercises we have created, selected from online sources, or adapted from online sources that our visitors can complete in approximately 90 minutes. This provides a forward progress and the ability to earn achievement stickers for your nametag.
