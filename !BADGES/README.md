# Badges: What's up With That?

Starting in 2020, Seattle CoderDojo now provides every child, parent, and volunteer who attends an event with a 4x6 inch name tag, a clear holder, and a lanyard.

## The Name Tags

<img src="../images/seeker.png" height="300" align="left">Select your appropriate tag.

**CHILD:** Seeker (black)

**VOLUNTEER**: Mentor (blue)

**PARENT/ACCOMPANYING ADULT**: Guardian (green)

The design is exactly the same on both sides. In the large rounded rectangle on each side, write your name.

The name tags have a grid of hexagons on each side that can be filled up with achievement badges. These are stickers that you earn for completing different tasks.

Each name tag can hold 24 badges. If you achieve more, you have to start another name tag.  



## The Achievement Badges

<img src="../images/1stVisit.png" width="200" align="left">Everyone earns their "First Visit" badge just by coming. There's a "Second Visit" badge too. But then the next visit badge you can earn is the 4th, then the 7th. Just like in a game, the higher the level, the harder you have to work to earn the achievement.

**There are badges for participating**, like badges for asking for help, badges for helping others, and badges for giving a demo during the demo period.

**There are badges for learning**, like different levels in topics like VR, Unity, Scratch, and more.

**There are also badges for contributing**, like creating modules, leading a room, and helping with IT (making sure the laptops and equipment we own are kept in good shape).

### Do Achievements Unlock Anything?

Your potential?

We're still developing our achievement badge program, so we're open to suggestions about what might be unlocked by earning them.

### What Badges Are Available?

Check out our badge lists:

## Cool, I wanna make a badge!

### Can I Propose A Badge?

Badge proposals require a few bits of information. The most important are:

1. Who is it for? Seekers, Mentors, Guardians or some combination of the three?
2. What do they have to do to earn it?
3. Is it currently possible to earn it with resources we already have?

Please note, "you should have a badge for X" is not helpful if we don't have the resources to help people achieve X. If we don't have the resources to help people earn your badge, you'll need to explain how they will be created or acquired.

Please also note that someone has to design the badge, it must be approved, and then it will cost us money to print it.

### Can I Sponsor A New Badge?

We currently print badges in runs of 1,000 stickers with allstickerprinting.com. The badge costs $29.99 and we have to pay the state approx $3 in use tax.

You may contribute $35 by PayPal ($33 + $2 for PayPal fees) directly to Seattle CoderDojo if you don't need a tax deduction. $39 by PayPal or \$37 by check to Urban Sparks if you do need a tax deduction.

We appreciate Urban Sparks support of our mission, but they have to do paperwork and oversight to accept tax-deductible donations on our behalf, so there is a processing fee we have to add for donations meant to cover specific costs.

Please contact us for links or addresses for making the donation.

### Can I Design A Badge?

We welcome people who want to make badges. There are a few requirements.

1. Use our template. We currently provide a [Photoshop format](../images/hextemplate.psd) template.
2. Badges must be in print ready CMYK color. Please note that many design tools do not support CMYK output. If you are not experienced in creating 4-color print-ready artwork, please talk to a mentor about learning how. We will try to create a module for it soon.
3. You need to sketch out the design and have it approved first.
4. The badge needs to be for an _accepted_ proposal. We are trying to decide where to list accepted proposals that need an artist. For now, connect with us at an event or by email for more information.
