# Contributing to the DojoGuides

The DojoGuides define modules students can work on at a meetup of Seattle CoderDojo. This may be a simple website project they create with HTML, a set of Arduino experiments, or a Unity Mini-Game.

## YOU CAN DO THIS!

* **Your modules can be original, but do not have to be. **
* **They may simply explain and add value to a tutorial on another site.**
* **They may copy content from another site, but only if that content has an open source or Creative Commons license that allows copying/re-use.**

## DO YOU WANT TO AWARD AN ACHIEVEMENT BADGE?

See our [Badges][./!BADGES] guide for info on creating and awarding achievement badges.

## BEFORE YOU GET STARTED

Please make sure your module isn't duplicating content we already have. If it's similar to one we already have, does it put enough of a new and interesting twist on the skills or topic.

If you want to have a higher likelihood of your module being published in this repo, open an issue and describe what you're trying to make. Our more experienced volunteers will review it and give you feedback so you can start on the right track.

Read our module form. Knowing the information you'll need to provide not just in the module, but *about* the module will help you focus your thoughts as you create or evaluate tutorials.

## GOOD RULES OF THUMB

Fun is important. This isn't school. No child is forced to complete a module. So try to figure out ways

## WHAT YOU'LL NEED

[Module Template](./Module_Template.md) - Use the module template as the basis for your module.
[Entry Template](./EntryTemplate.md) - Every module requires a corresponding entry in the readme file for the folder it's in. 

## HOW TO SUBMIT A MODULE

This is all done via Github. We might want to make a module for that.

Fork the DojoGuides repository. Create your module in the appropriate directory. Commit your module. Push your module to your fork (if developing locally). Submit a pull request. We'll try to respond within a couple of days.
